    <h1>Why my cats are great?</h1>

    <img src="assets/catfot1.png" alt="My cats."/>

    <p>This is my first website and I have decided to dedicate it to my three cats. Their names are Bisbis, Fıstık and Lulu.</p>
    
    <h2>Bisbis:</h2> 
    <img src="assets/bisbis1.png" alt="Bisbis" />
    <p>Bisbis (gray and white) is the oldest of the three at 10 years of age and is a very loving, stubborn, clingy and grumpy guy. 
    He is the acting cat boss in the house and everything belongs to him.</p> 
    <p>Top Three Things Bisbis Loves:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Tuna fish</li>  <img src="assets/tuna1.png" alt="Tuna fish"/> 
     <li>Chicken</li> <img src="assets/chicken1.png" alt="Chicken"/>
     <li>Not giving people space</li> <img src="assets/nospace1.png" alt="Get off me!"/>
    </ol>


    
    <h3>Fıstık:</h3> 
    <img src="assets/fistik1.png" alt="Fıstık" />
    <p>Fıstık (the guy with the "scary stripes" on his face) is the cowardly middle child. He is 8 years old and very cautious at any given time. 
    He really likes attention but does not like to be touched unless he's in the livingroom. He spends his time loudly calling us there. </p>  
    </p>
    <p>Top Three Things Fıstık Loves:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Bisbis</li>  <img src="assets/abi2.png" alt="Fıstık and Bisbis"/> 
     <li>Sleeping</li> <img src="assets/sleepingfistik1.png" alt="Sleeping Fıstık"/>
     <li>Being left alone</li> <img src="assets/leftalone1.png" alt="Leave me alone!"/>
    </ol>

    
    <h4>Lulu:</h4>
    <img src="assets/lulu1.png" alt="Lulu" />
    <p>Lulu (Fat one with the tiny head) is the youngest of the three at age 3 and is the only female. She is very loving and she's afraid of everything apart from Fıstık. 
    Lulu and Fıstık have a love/hate relationship since after Fıstık's first attempt at courting Lulu and failing miserably, he has been permanently placed in the friendzone. 
    Fıstık complains about this constantly.</p>
